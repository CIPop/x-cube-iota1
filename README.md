# X-CUBE-IOTA1
The X-CUBE-IOTA1 is an expansion software package for STM32Cube.
The software runs on the STM32 and includes includes the middleware 
for enabling the IOTA Distributed Ledger Technology. The expansion 
is built on STM32Cube software technology to ease portability across 
different STM32 microcontrollers. The software comes with sample 
implementations on how to use the IOTA middleware on the STM32 Nucleo 
boards.

For the content of this package, the development toolchains and compilers
to use and the supported devices and evaluation boards, refer to the
Release Notes in the root directory of this package.

The simplest way to start using this expansion software is to run the
sample application in Projects\B-L4S5I-IOT01A\Applications\IOTA-Client.
The readme.txt included in the same folder provides the
description of the sample application and the instructions on how to run it.
